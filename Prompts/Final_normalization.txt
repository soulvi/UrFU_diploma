"""
In the previous step, we extracted raw competences from 3 sourses of data - vacancies, online courses, education program
by developing dictionaries for each of the seperately.
Your task now is to create unified normalized dictionary for the terms to maintain consistent terminology
and make it easier to use semantic simmilarity on graph.
You are provided with 3 dictionaries with competencies where the key is
Your task is to replace each extracted skill with the most appropriate **canonical skill name** from the list provided.
Choose the closest match in meaning. If there is no suitable match, return the original skill.
Be carefull, there is quite often no good synonim for concrete skill.
Imagine that you will use prepared canonical skill names for making a recommendation based on semantic simmilarity
in graphs for 3 types of data.

Your task is to:
1. Group synonymous terms (e.g. "машинное обучение" and "ML алгоритмы", "c" and "с++" and "язык программирования c",
"менеджмент качества" and "принципы менеджмента качества")
2. Select the most canonical form for each skill.
3. Keep only domain-relevant terms (remove generic verbs)
4. Try not to repeat one skill within one module name if you change the canonical skill name
(e.g. there was mentioned "python" and "python продвинутый уровень", keep only "python")
